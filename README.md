# Personalized Health and Wellness Recommendation System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Personalized Health and Wellness Recommendation System project. In this innovative endeavor, we aim to develop a robust and comprehensive backend-only system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. By utilizing microservices architecture, Spring Boot, JPA, API Gateway, Discovery Server, and an Authentication Service, our platform will provide tailored health and wellness recommendations, facilitate progress tracking, encourage community engagement, offer nutrition information, support mental health, leverage data analytics, and provide feedback analysis.

### Key Features and Components

- **Microservices Architecture:** Our system will employ a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability. Each microservice will address specific aspects of health and wellness recommendations and data management.

- **Spring Boot:** Spring Boot will serve as the foundational framework for developing microservices, expediting the creation of robust and scalable back-end services.

- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** JPA will facilitate data persistence and interaction with a relational database. Entities representing user profiles, health data, recommendations, feedback, and community interactions will be defined and managed using JPA.

- **API Gateway:** An API Gateway will centralize request routing, security, and authentication, ensuring a unified and secure API surface for client interactions.

- **Discovery Server:** The Discovery Server will manage service registration and discovery for microservices, enabling dynamic scaling and load balancing to ensure system reliability.

- **Authentication Service:** The Authentication Service will handle user registration, login, and session management. Secure user authentication and access token generation will be implemented.
